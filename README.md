# Winter 2020 Advanced Remote Sensing and Earth Observation
CEE 498 B, CEWA 599 D, SEFS 521 C, CEWA 599 A

These are files to build a github website hosting the [SEFS 521 Advanced Earth Observation Course](https://uwearthobservation.github.io/Labs/) course content designed for Google Earth Engine and modeled off UW's [Geohackweek content](https://geohackweek.github.io/). Github automatically renders these files using Ruby to build the website.

Pull-requests to expand on our tutorial content are encouraged. Changes can be made to the markdown files located in the [episodes folder](https://github.com/uwearthobservation/Labs/tree/gh-pages/_episodes)

The course syllabus can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PY4jnabTCNhAO4tpDM_lghmeulvItXxN_3SPVfHUJHA/edit?usp=sharing)
